# myWebsite
My own simple website.

The goal of this project was to build a website using many of the latest tools with the purpose of demonstrating my knowledge of software development and demonstrating my eagerness to learn the latest tech.

As they say "a picture is worth a thousand words".

Some of the tools I used in this project:

  Front End : 
    React, Webpack, Babel, React-Router, Bootstrap4
  
  Back End : 
    Express, Amazon Web Services EC2, MongoDB (for blog which is currently WIP)
